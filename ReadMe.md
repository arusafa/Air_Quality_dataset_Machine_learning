- The objective of this project is to perform a regression analysis on the Air Quality dataset using a neural network built with Keras. The project involves data preprocessing, splitting the data into training and testing sets, normalizing the data, building and training the model, and evaluating its performance using k-fold cross-validation.

- Technology Stack Used:

  - Python: The primary programming language used for this project.
  - Pandas: For data manipulation and cleaning.
  - NumPy: For numerical operations.
  - Matplotlib: For data visualization.
  - Scikit-learn: For data splitting and preprocessing.
  - Keras with TensorFlow backend: For building and training the neural network model.
